        <h2>What is a Higher-Order Component (HOC)?</h2>
        <p>A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component as input and returns an enhanced component with additional functionality. It follows the higher-order function pattern in JavaScript, where functions can accept other functions as arguments and return new functions.
        HOCs are not a built-in feature of React, but rather a pattern used for reusing component logic.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Use Higher-Order Components?</h2>
        <p>
        HOCs help solve common problems such as:
        âœ… Code Reusability â€“ Share logic across multiple components.
        âœ… Separation of Concerns â€“ Keep UI and logic separate.
        âœ… Enhancing Components Dynamically â€“ Add features like authentication, logging, or performance tracking without modifying the original component.
        </p>

        <h2>Important Notes on HOCs</h2>
        <p>
        ðŸ“Œ Avoid modifying the original component directly. Always return a new component.
ðŸ“Œ Preserve Props â€“ Use ...props to pass down all original props.
ðŸ“Œ Use Meaningful Names â€“ Wrap components with meaningful names like withAuth, withLogging, etc.
ðŸ“Œ Can Be Nested â€“ You can apply multiple HOCs to a single component.

        When to Use HOCs?
        </h2>
        <p>
        âœ… When you need to add the same behavior to multiple components (e.g., logging, authentication, analytics).
âœ… When you want to modify a componentâ€™s props dynamically without modifying its code.
âœ… When you need to add lifecycle methods to functional components (before hooks were introduced).
